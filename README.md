# WiggleBin

The mission of WiggleBin is to craft an **open-source, intelligent vermicomposting bin** that cultivates joy for both worms and their human stewards. 

In order to craft an open-source, intelligent composting bin, it's crucial to delve into the Umwelt (perceptual world) of worms. Hence, we've introduced the [WiggleR](./WiggleR/README.md), our innovative open-source desktop composting research unit.

Embark on a captivating, modern-day Darwinian journey into the realm of worms by creating your very own [WiggleR](./WiggleR/README.md). Join us in this thrilling endeavor!

## Why?

Managing a worm bin comes with its share of challenges. Worms may decide to make a hasty escape, contend with overheating, or face the risk of drying out. As a caring caretaker, your priority is ensuring the well-being of your worms. 

Yet, delving into the essence of worm happiness raises intriguing queries: What defines a worm's contentment? How can we gauge their emotional state? Moreover, how do these fascinating creatures navigate and perceive their surroundings through their unique sensory mechanisms?

 Here are some of the common problems.
- Overheating
- Drowning
- Too wet
- Too dry
- Lack of oxygen
- Over or under feeding
- Feeding the wrong food

## How?

The central focus of our initiative is [WiggleR](./WiggleR/README.md)â€”an uncomplicated and user-friendly desktop composting bin designed for controlled experiments.

Complementing this flagship project, we've developed several smaller, yet significant sub-projects:

1. WiggleGate (Soon to be released): A specialized sensor engineered to detect worm movement.
2. [WiggleAlert](./WiggleAlert/README.md): An alert system crafted to signal any signs of discomfort or unhappiness among the worms.
3. [WiggleBin](./WiggleBin/README.md): A straightforward and easily manageable worm bin, ideal for both creation and maintenance.
