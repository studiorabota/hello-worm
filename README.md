# WiggleBin

WiggleBin's mission is to create an **open-source, intelligent vermicomposting bin** that not only nurtures the well-being of worms but also brings joy to their human caretakers. T

Currently, our project is in the research and testing phase. To conduct thorough investigations, we have developed the [WiggleR](https://github.com/wiggle-bin/wiggle-r)â€”an innovative desktop research unit designed for conducting controlled experiments with worms.

## Why?

Managing a worm bin comes with its share of challenges. Worms may attempt to escape, face risks of overheating, or become too dry. As a caring caretaker, ensuring the well-being of your worms is a priority. The question arises: How can you gauge the happiness of your worms without daily disruptions, constant checks, and the inevitable task of getting your hands dirty?

Here are some of the common problems.
- Overheating
- Drowning
- Too wet
- Too dry
- Lack of oxygen
- Over or under feeding
- Feeding the wrong food
