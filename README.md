# WiggleBin

The goal of WiggleBin is to make an open-source smart [vermicomposting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermicompost) bin which makes both **worms** and **humans** happy.

This project is in the research and testing phase. Currently our research involves trying out different sensors. See [issues](https://github.com/studiorabota/wiggle-bin/issues) for more info and how to contribute. Check [milestones](https://github.com/studiorabota/wiggle-bin/milestones) for our future plans.

> This documentation does not go into how to vermicompost. Plenty of other resources are available online.

## License

The WiggleBin is open source hardware. Hardware is covered under CERN-OHL-S-2.0 (`LICENSE.CERN-OHL-S-2.0.txt`) license and software under GPL-3.0-or-later (`LICENSE.GPL-3.0-or-later.txt`) license.

## Why?

Maintaining a worm bin is not without complications. Worms can "run" away, overheat or dry out. As a friendly human you want the best for your worms. So how can you know if your worms are happy? - without checking everyday, disturbing the worms and getting dirty hands.

 Here are some of the common problems.
- Overheating
- Drowning
- Too wet
- Too dry
- Lack of oxygen
- Over or under feeding
- Feeding the wrong food

## How?

The Wiggle project contains 3 sub-projects.

1. [WiggleBin](Build-WiggleBin.md): Easy to make and maintain worm bin
2. [WiggleAlert](Build-WiggleAlert.md): Alert system for unhappy worms
3. [WiggleR](Build-WiggleR.md): Small desktop unit for controlled experiments

## Thanks!

Many thanks to [Open Hardware Academy](https://www.openhardware.academy/01_Welcome.html) and [Stadslab Rotterdam](https://stadslabrotterdam.nl/) for making this build possible.
