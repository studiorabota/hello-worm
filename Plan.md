# WiggleBin Plan

- Experiment with different sensors. Sensor above or in the soil?
- Make a first prototype with bucket and WebThings
- Do worms get annoyed by electronic sensors in the soil? 
- Make a 3D file sensor attachment to bucket
- Probably the worm bin is not close to a socket.. can we power the sensors with a battery and send it to a central point? Will radio reduce energy needed? or should we use wifi?
- Analayze sensor data with Pandas
- Make 3D file for complete bin
- Build a prototype of the bin
- Test microwave sensor
- Make documentaion like [PreciousPlastic](https://preciousplastic.com) with a basic, pro and community versions. 
- Make the code installer like [CandleSmart](https://www.candlesmarthome.com/get-candle) home, allowing for a selection of sensors to be used.
- Make an app which can connect to the bin
- See if weather data can be used to make predictions
- ...
- Find a way to count worms :)
